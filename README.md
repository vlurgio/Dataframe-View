This module allows you to read a dataframe using python flask and pandas as the backend with react as the frontend. 
Reading dataframes is generally speaking difficult when performing nlp tasks and your data is all text. Thus here it is
all the power of pandas all the beauty of react. You can sort a column by clicking it's title  as well multi sort by shift-
clicking. The search bars default to using case insentive regex but this can be changed as well as search done on mulitple
columns at once. You can show/hide the columns as well in the filter bar at the bottom.


To start the app:
  bash start.sh (this starts both front and backend)

  when you're done be sure to kill the flask server running on port 5000
